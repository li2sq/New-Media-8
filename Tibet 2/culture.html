Tibetan culture and identity is inseparably linked to Tibetan Buddhism.
Religious practice and Buddhist principles are a part of daily life for most Tibetans. 
Monks and nuns play a key role in their communities, providing guidance and education.
They are often very active in protecting and promoting Tibet's environment, language and
culture.Almost all Tibetans are deeply devoted to the Dalai Lama and his exile and treatment
by the Chinese government are sources of grief and anger.Tibetans' allegiance to the Dalai 
Lama and to Tibetan Buddhism is seen as a danger to the occupying Chinese state and, as a 
result, all aspects of religious practice are closely monitored and controlled.Simply possessing
an image of the Dalai Lama can result in arrest and torture.Monks and nuns are frequently 
targeted by security restrictions and they make up a significant proportion of political prisoners 
in Tibet.
